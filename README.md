# C - Simple Shell
***

## Our Shell
The idea for this project is to create our own Linux shell using the C programming language.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to

## Description
A shell is a command-line interpreter, a sort of middle-man between the user and the operating system and its programs. The user tells the shell what program they want to use (and how) and the shell takes care of executing said program and handling any errors that may occur (among other things).
